Ever wondered what your favorite website would sound like as a song? **Webpage Singer** takes any webpage, turns its content into lyrics, and transforms it into an actual track. Just drop in a URL and let the music happen.  

## How it works ðŸŽ¤  

1. **Scrape the webpage**. We grab the text from any URL you provide with Apify's [Website Content Crawler](https://apify.com/apify/website-content-crawler)
2. **Generate the lyrics**. We use the OpenAI API to rewrite the content into song lyrics.  
3. **Create the music**. The lyrics get turned into a full-blown song in your chosen genre using [TopMediai](https://www.topmediai.com/)

Just a small warning - it can take up to 5 minutes to generate a song, so be patient!

## Why use this? ðŸ¤”  

- **For fun**. Turn your favorite website into a banger.  
- **For creativity**. Get AI-generated lyrics and music for inspiration.  
- **For pranks**. Surprise your friends with a song about their blog.  
- **For memes**. Convert the latest viral post into a track.  

## What genres can it do? ðŸŽ¸  

From pop to punk, rap to reggae, Webpage Singer can craft a song that fits the vibe you are going for. Just feed it a URL, pick your style, and let it do the magic.

If you don't enter a genre, the AI will suggest one based on the content of the web page. It might surprise you with a genre you've never even heard of!

## How much does it cost? ðŸ’°  

- **Scraping the webpage**. A tiny fee of $0.01 to $0.05 depending on the page complexity.
- **Creating the song**. Generating a full track costs $0.15 per song with pay-per-event pricing, or just $0.05 per song if you bring your own TopMediai API token.
- **Try it for free!** The Actor is paid, but the $5 you get from Apify in your account is enough for ~30 songs. You can generate plenty of songs without a credit card.
